#  Discuss About Python  Dictionary all possible Questions with answer and Additional concept

#  üß† A. Basics and Definition
# What is a dictionary in Python?
# What is the syntax of a Python dictionary?
'''
In python, Dictionary is a Data Structure that store data as a key-value pairs.
Dictionary items(key and value pairs) are ordered, mutable and do not allow dupplicate keys. allow can only values.

Syntax:  dict_name = {
    "key1":"Value1",
    "key1":"Value1",
    .....
}

'''
# How is a dictionary different from lists, tuples, and sets?
'''
Dictionary is a different from lists , tuples and set because dictionary store data in the form of key-value pairs but 
list, tuples only store individual Element ( values only) not keys. 
and set store only unique and unordered element.

Example: 
Dictionary:
student = {
    "Name" : "Mahadeb",
    "Age": 22
}

List:
Student = ["Mahadeb",22]
tuple:
Student = ("Mahadeb",22)
set:
Student = {"Mahadeb",22}
'''
# What are dictionary keys and values?
'''
In programming, dictionaries store data in key-value pairs,
key: A key acts like an index ‚Äî it must be unique and immutable (e.g., string, number, or tuple).
value: A value is the data or information associated with that key ‚Äî it can be of any data type (string, list, dictionary, etc.),
       Can be duplicated: Unlike keys, multiple values within a dictionary can be identical. 


# A dictionary where names are keys and ages are values
person = {
    "name": "Alice", # "name" is the key, "Alice" is the value
    "age": 30,       # "age" is the key, 30 is the value
    "city": "New York" # "city" is the key, "New York" is the value
}

# To access a value, you use its key
print(person["name"])    # Output: Alice

# To add a new key-value pair, or to update an existing one
person["job"] = "Engineer" # "job" is a new key, "Engineer" is its value
person["age"] = 31         # Updates the value for the "age" key

# The updated dictionary now looks like this
print(person)
# Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 31, 'city': 'New York', 'job': 'Engineer'}

'''
# Can a dictionary have duplicate keys? Why or why not?
# Can dictionary values be duplicated? 
'''
No,Dictionary Can not have Duplicate keys because each key in a dictionary must be unique ‚Äî if a duplicate key is assigned, the latest value will overwrite the previous one.
and immutable ( Not changable).

deeply:
Reason:
A dictionary is internally implemented using a hash table.
Each key is converted into a hash value, and only one entry per hash can exist.
Therefore, duplicate keys are not allowed, but values can be duplicated.
'''
# How to create an empty dictionary?
'''
empty_Dict = {}
print(empty_Dict,type(empty_Dict))
# output will be: {} <class 'dict'>
'''
# How to create a dictionary using the dict() constructor?
'''
Employee_Info = dict(Nama = "Mahadeb Maity",Age = 22,Address = "Manikara",IsMarried = False)
print(Employee_Info)
'''
# How is a dictionary mutable?
'''
A dictionary is mutable because its contents (key‚Äìvalue pairs) can be changed after creation ‚Äî
meaning you can add, modify, or remove items without creating a new dictionary.

student = {"name": "Mahadeb", "age": 22}
student["age"] = 23   # Modifying existing value
print(student)
student["course"] = "MCA"   # Adding new item
print(student)
'''

# What data types can be used as dictionary keys?
'''
Dictionary keys must be immutable and hashable. 
Allowed types include: int, float, str, bool, tuple (of immutables), and frozenset. 
Mutable types like list, set, and dict cannot be used as keys.

# What is the get() method?

Answer of the both Questions :
get() is a method to access Dictionary key value pair safely without  occurs any error if key's does't exists into  given Dictionary 



there are two ways to access nested dictionary key's and value pairs

| Concept                  | Explanation                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Unordered before 3.7** | Dictionaries used hash tables without insertion order guarantee.               |
| **Ordered from 3.7+**    | Dicts preserve insertion order (officially guaranteed).                        |
| **Hashability**          | Keys must be immutable (like string, int, tuple) so hash value doesn‚Äôt change. |
| **Internal structure**   | Implemented as a **hash table** (key ‚Üí hash ‚Üí index ‚Üí value).                  |
| **Unpacking (`**`)**     | Expands dictionary items into function arguments or merges two dicts.          |
| **`in` operator**        | Checks only keys, not values ‚Üí `'x' in d` checks if `'x'` is a key.            |
| **Mutable key issue**    | Mutable types like list cannot be hashed ‚Üí error if used as key.               |
| **Memory efficiency**    | Dicts use hashing ‚Üí faster lookups than lists of tuples.                       |
| **Collision handling**   | Python uses **open addressing** and **probing** to resolve hash collisions.    |
| **Real-world uses**      | JSON, database mappings, config files, data caching, API responses.            |
