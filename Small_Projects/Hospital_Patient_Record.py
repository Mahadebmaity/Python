# Q6. Hospital Patient Records

# ðŸ‘‰ Problem:
# Each patient record looks like:

# {
#    "patient_id": 501,
#    "name": "Madhurima",
#    "age": 25,
#    "medical_history": {
#        "diseases": ["Fever", "Cold"],
#        "allergies": ["Penicillin"]
#    }
# }
# Add new patients.
# Search by name or ID.
# Update medical history (append new disease/allergy).
# Save into patients.json.
