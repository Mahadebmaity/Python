# Q2. Employee Records
# ðŸ‘‰ Problem:
# Build a program that stores employee details in the following format:

# {
#    "emp_id": 201,
#    "name": "Amit",
#    "department": "IT",
#    "salary": {
#        "basic": 25000,
#        "hra": 10000,
#        "bonus": 5000
#    }
# }

# Store multiple employees in a list.
# Save them into a file (employees.json).
# Write code to calculate total salary from salary nested dictionary.
