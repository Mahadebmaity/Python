# 1. Basics of Tuple
# What is a tuple in Python?
'''
Tuple: Tuple is an ordered , immutable collection of element enclose by parenthesis ().it can store duplicate value and multiple datatype value.
'''
# How is a tuple different from typing import Tuple
'''
1. Tuple (built-in type)
When you write tuple, you‚Äôre using Python‚Äôs built-in data type that stores an ordered, immutable sequence of elements.

Tuple from typing module:
not creating a real tuple ‚Äî instead, you‚Äôre describing the type of a tuple for type hints (annotations).

ex:
from typing import Tuple

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Using the built-in tuple
my_data = ("Mahadeb", 21, "India")
print(my_data)                 # ('Mahadeb', 21, 'India')
print(type(my_data))           # <class 'tuple'>

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Using Tuple from typing (for type hinting)
def get_student_info() -> Tuple[str, int, str]:
    return ("Mahadeb", 21, "India")

# Function call
info = get_student_info()
print(info)                    # ('Mahadeb', 21, 'India')
print(type(info))              # <class 'tuple'>

reviced writng :
def get_student() -> Tuple[str,int,str]:
    return ("String Name", Any Numbers,"String Name")

Tuples are stored in a fixed-size memory (static), lists use dynamic arrays.

# Why is tuple faster than list?
'''
1Ô∏è‚É£ Why is tuple faster than list?
‚úÖ Reason:

Tuples are immutable ‚Üí their contents cannot change after creation.

Lists are mutable ‚Üí they allow adding, removing, and modifying elements.

Because of this:

Python can optimize memory storage and iteration speed for tuples.

No need to allocate extra space or manage dynamic resizing (which lists require).

‚öôÔ∏è Example:
import timeit

print(timeit.timeit("(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)", number=1000000))   # tuple creation
print(timeit.timeit("[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]", number=1000000))   # list creation


üí° Result:
The tuple version usually runs faster than the list version.
'''
# What happens if you use + or * with tuples?
'''
‚ûï 2Ô∏è‚É£ What happens if you use + or * with tuples?
üß© Tuple concatenation (+)

Combines two tuples into a new one.

Example:

a = (1, 2, 3)
b = (4, 5)
print(a + b)   # (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

‚úñÔ∏è Tuple repetition (*)

Repeats the tuple elements.

Example:

a = (1, 2)
print(a * 3)   # (1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2)

‚ö†Ô∏è Important:

These operations create new tuples ‚Äî since tuples are immutable, the original tuples are not changed.
'''
# Can tuple comprehension exist in Python? If not, then what happens?
'''
No,
3Ô∏è‚É£ Can tuple comprehension exist in Python?
‚ùå No, tuple comprehension does not exist.

If you try:

t = (x**2 for x in range(5))
print(t)


You get:

<generator object <genexpr> at 0x...>


üëâ This means Python creates a generator, not a tuple.

‚úÖ To make it a tuple:

You must explicitly convert it:

t = tuple(x**2 for x in range(5))
print(t)   # (0, 1, 4, 9, 16)
